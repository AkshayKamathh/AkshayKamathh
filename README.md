# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Akshay  

ðŸ’» Backend Developer | Junior @ San JosÃ© State University (CS, Class of 2027)  

Iâ€™ve built backend systems, data pipelines, and AI tools across **Cisco**, **Tesla**, and SJSUâ€™s **Machine Intelligence Lab**:  
- **Cisco** â†’ Kafka + Spring Boot services, plus Python/SQL pipelines and GPT-4 agents that flagged $100M+ in variances  
- **Tesla** â†’ clustering + mapping to prioritize charger rollout, with a Flask + React Leaflet lookup tool  
- **SJSU Lab** â†’ TensorFlow models for battery health prediction, boosting accuracy by 15% and cutting inference time by 20%  

Outside of work, I co-founded **SJHACKS**, now SJSUâ€™s largest hackathon with 250+ students.
