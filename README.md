# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Akshay  

ðŸ’» Backend Developer | Junior @ San JosÃ© State University (CS, Class of 2027)  

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve had the chance to work across **Cisco**, **Tesla**, and SJSUâ€™s **Machine Intelligence Lab**, building systems that are reliable, scalable, and impactful:  

- At **Cisco**, I built Kafka-based services in Java + Spring Boot, deployed with Docker and Kubernetes, and later engineered Python/SQL pipelines and AI agents with LangChain + GPT-4 that flagged $100M+ in subscription variances.  
- At **Tesla**, I helped the sales team by clustering 12k+ parking lots with scikit-learn to prioritize charger rollout and built a Flask + React Leaflet tool for one-click parking lot owner lookup.  
- In the **Machine Intelligence Lab**, Iâ€™ve trained deep learning models in TensorFlow to predict lithium-ion battery health, improving accuracy by 15% and cutting inference time by 20%.  

Outside of work, I co-founded **SJHACKS**, now the biggest hackathon at SJSU, bringing together 250+ students last year and growing.  

At the end of the day, Iâ€™m someone who learns fast, enjoys the grind of problem-solving, and likes being around motivated people.
