# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Akshay  

ðŸ’» Backend Developer | Junior @ San JosÃ© State University (CS, Class of 2027)  

I like building systems that are reliable, scalable, and make peopleâ€™s jobs easier. Most of my experience has been on the backendâ€”working with data pipelines, distributed services, and APIs at companies like **Cisco** and **Tesla**, and doing research in SJSUâ€™s Machine Intelligence Lab.  

I learn best by doing: whether thatâ€™s standing up Kafka pipelines for financial data, writing Flask APIs to support Teslaâ€™s sales team, or training models to predict battery health. Outside of work, I helped start **SJHACKS**, now the biggest hackathon at SJSU.  

At the end of the day, Iâ€™m someone who likes solving problems, moving fast, and being around motivated people.
