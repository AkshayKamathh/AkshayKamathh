# üëã Hey, I‚Äôm Akshay  

üíª Backend Developer | Junior @ San Jos√© State University (CS, Class of 2027)  

I like building systems that are reliable, scalable, and make people‚Äôs jobs easier. Most of my experience has been on the backend‚Äîworking with data pipelines, distributed services, and APIs at companies like **Cisco** and **Tesla**, and doing research in SJSU‚Äôs Machine Intelligence Lab.  

I learn best by doing: whether that‚Äôs standing up Kafka pipelines for financial data, writing Flask APIs to support Tesla‚Äôs sales team, or training models to predict battery health. Outside of work, I helped start **SJHACKS**, now the biggest hackathon at SJSU.  

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm someone who likes solving problems, moving fast, and being around motivated people.
