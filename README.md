💻 Backend Developer | Junior @ San José State University (CS, Class of 2027)

I develop backend systems, data pipelines and AI tools. I’ve gained experience at **Cisco**, **Tesla** and in SJSU’s **Machine Intelligence & Complex Systems Lab**:

- **Cisco** → Built Kafka + Spring Boot services, Python/SQL pipelines and GPT‑4 agents that flagged over \$100M in subscription variances, cutting manual review by 85%.  
- **Tesla** → Applied clustering and mapping to prioritize charger rollout and created a Flask + React Leaflet tool with a PostgreSQL backend for one‑click lookups.  
- **SJSU Research** → Trained TensorFlow models to predict battery health, improving accuracy by 15% and cutting inference time by 20%.

Outside of work, I co‑founded **SJHACKS**, now SJSU’s largest hackathon with 250+ participants and growing.
